//First version of my solution checked whether the current line contains more than
//two numbers, since the challenge stated FIRST and LAST number, but turns out both can be the
//same, e.g: `eighttkbtzjz6nineeight` this only contains one numeric value -> 6, this is both the
//FIRST as the LAST value, soo this would become 66 in total for this specific line.

lastNumber = line[i];
